# `Spotify Playlist Generator`
A full stack application that leverages the Spotify API to create interesting playlists.

# Quick Start Guide
There are a few steps you need to perform in order to start using the `Spotify Playlist Generator`.

1. Open two terminals, navigate to both the `spotify-backend` and `spotify-web-app` directories and run:

    > npm install  

    This will install all of the necessary dependencies to run both NodeJS and React.
2. Next, with both of those terminals still open we will start the services.  
    1. Within the `spotify-web-app` directory run: 

        > npm start  

    2. Within the `spotify-backend` directory run: 

        > export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID={ *insert client id here* }  
        > export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET={ *insert client secret here* }  
        > npm start

3. Then go to http://localhost:8888/login in your browser to begin the login workflow.  

Once all of these steps are completed, the `Spotify Playlist Generator` should be successfully up and running.
